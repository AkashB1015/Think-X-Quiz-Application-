## Think-X-Quiz-Application-
Designed and developed a Quiz Application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Implemented RESTful APIs for quiz management, real-time scoring, and result analysis. Built a responsive React-based user interface with optimized backend services. Secured the application using JWT authentication and role-based access control.



## 🏠 ThinkX – Home Page

The Home Page is the main landing screen of the ThinkX web-based MERN stack project. It is developed using React.js for the frontend and provides smooth navigation using React Router.

The page includes a responsive navigation bar with links like Home, About, Services, Register, Contact, and Sign In. It allows users to easily access different sections of the application.

The Hero section introduces the platform with the tagline “Learn Through Every Question” and encourages users to start their learning journey through interactive quizzes.

The Register and Sign In buttons are connected to the backend authentication system built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB for secure user management.

The page also highlights key features such as topic-based quizzes, score tracking, and progress analysis, along with a footer containing contact details and developer information.
